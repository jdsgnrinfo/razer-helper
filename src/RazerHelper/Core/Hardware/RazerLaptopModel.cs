/// The controller really applies <see cref="RazerCommands.SetBatteryChargeLimit"/>.
/// Some older firmware echoes every class 0x07 command as if it took it and
/// then does nothing, so this cannot be detected from the reply.
/// </param>
/// <param name="MaxFan">
/// How this model runs its fans flat out. The controller flag
/// (<see cref="RazerCommands.SetMaxFan"/>) has the same class 0x07 caveat as
/// <paramref name="HasChargeLimit"/>: where it is only echoed, the older
/// manual fan method may work instead.
/// </param>
/// <param name="HasKeyboardColor">
/// A static keyboard color of the user's choice, through the standard matrix
/// effect (<see cref="RazerCommands.SetStandardEffect"/>). Checked on the model
/// by eye: white sent this way lit the keyboard white.
/// </param>
/// <param name="HasFanSpeeds">
/// The controller reports real fan speeds (<see cref="RazerCommands.GetActualFanRpm"/>).
/// Where it does not, the fan speed line is left out from the start rather
/// than removed on the first reading.
/// </param>
/// <param name="HasWaveEffect">
/// The keyboard can show a wave. A single-zone keyboard (the whole board one
/// light) cannot, whichever command is sent, so Wave is not offered there.
